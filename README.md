# ContinuesVoiceRecognition
Android Docs say very clearly that SpeechRecognition is not intended to use as Continues Speech Recognition, but there is a way to trigger the SpeechRecognizer from a voice comman,  You should try PocketSphinx, a very good library that react to "magic" word and react to it(the continues recognition is not good enough yet). the combination between the pocket  Sphinx and this implementation is a very good idea.  check out PocketSphinx here: https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx-android-demo
